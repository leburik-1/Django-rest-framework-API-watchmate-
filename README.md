# Django-rest-framework-API

This is a very simple API that ables us to apply CRUD functions as well as design a database that interlates with each other that is built using Django(python web framework) and built with a Django rest framework(librarie for API).
To test the API we can use CURL or httpie or using DRF's web based panel.
